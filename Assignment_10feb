Q1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode of file opening.
ANS- There are many modes for opening a file: r - open a file in read mode. w - opens or create a text file in write mode. a - opens a file in append mode.

Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?
ANS- The close() method closes an open file. You should always close your files, in
some cases, due to buffering, changes made to a file may not show until you close the file.

Q3. Write a python program to create a text file. Write ‘I want to become a Data Scientist’ in that file. Then
close the file. Open this file and read the content of the file.
ANS- 
f = open("myfile.txt", "w")
f.write("I want to become data scientist")

f.close()
f = open("myfile.txt", "r")
print(f.read())

Q4. Explain the following with python code: read(), readline() and readlines().
ANS- 
f = open("myfile.txt", "w")
f.write("I want to become data scientist njsnsamdsajdd \n dkjnck c dhdcdnc dcmcjan \n cjcijd jismkssd \n jiubsh s")

f.close()
f = open("myfile.txt", "r")
# print(f.read()) 
# print(f.readline())
# print(f.readlines())

Q5. Explain why with statement is used with open(). What is the advantage of using with statement and open() together?
ANS- What is the advantage of using with statement and open () together?
The with statement works with the open() function to open a file. Unlike open() where you have to close the file with the close() method, 
the with statement closes the file for you without you telling it to. This is because the with statement calls 2 built-in methods behind 
the scene – __enter()__ and __exit()__ .

Q6. Explain the write() and writelines() functions. Give a suitable example.
ANS- What are the functions write () and Writelines ()?
The only difference between the write() and writelines() is that write() is used to write a string to an already opened file while 
writelines() method is used to write a list of strings in an opened file.
