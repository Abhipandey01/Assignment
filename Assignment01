 Q1-Explain with an example each when to use a for loop and a while loop?

ANS- Through the use of for loop we can direct access the elements present in the list but when we use while loop then there we have to use indexing.
For loop is the easy method for negative traversing of the elements present in list or arrays.
EXAMPLE- we have a string which length is unknown and our goal is access the elements in that string then the easy way is using for loop and 
in same problem when we know about the length of the string then we can use the while loop."""

Q2- Write a python program to print the sum and product of the first 10 natural numbers using for and while loop.

ANS- using of FOR LOOP
sum=0
for i in range(1,11):
  sum+=i
print(sum)
 # using of WHILE LOOP
i=1
sum=0
while(i<11):
  sum+=i
  i+=1
print(sum)

 Q3. Create a python program to compute the electricity bill for a household.
''' The per-unit charges in rupees are as follows: For the first 100 units, the user will be charged Rs. 4.5 per
unit, for the next 100 units, the user will be charged Rs. 6 per unit, and for the next 100 units, the user will
be charged Rs. 10 per unit, After 300 units and above the user will be charged Rs. 20 per unit.
You are required to take the units of electricity consumed in a month from the user as input.
Your program must pass this test case: when the unit of electricity consumed by the user in a month is
310, the total electricity bill should be 2250.'''

Unit=int(input("Enter the Total Units : "))
Charges=0
if Unit<=100 :
  Charges=Unit*4.5
elif Unit>100 and Unit<=200 :
  Charges=(100*4.5)+((Unit-100)*6)
elif Unit>200 and Unit<=300:
  Charges=(100*4.5)+(100*6)+((Unit-200)*10)
else:
  Charges=(100*4.5)+(100*6)+(100*10)+((Unit-300)*20)
print(Charges)

 Q4. Create a list of numbers from 1 to 100. Use for loop and while loop to calculate the cube of each
number and if the cube of that number is divisible by 4 or 5 then append that number in a list and print
that list. 

# using FOR LOOP
list1=[]
list2=list(range(1,101))
for i in list2:
  if (i**3)%4==0 or (i**3)%5==0 :
    list1.append(i)
print(list1)
  
# using WHILE LOOP
list1=[]
list2=list(range(1,101))
i=0
while(i<len(list2)):
  if (list2[i]**3)%4==0 or (list2[i]**3)%5==0 :
    list1.append(list2[i])
  i+=1
print(list1)


''' Q5. Write a program to filter count vowels in the below-given string.
string = "I want to become a data scientist" '''

string = "I want to become a data scientist"
list1=['a','e','i','o','u','A','E','I','O','U']
count=0
for i in string:
  if i in list1:
    count+=1
print(count)
