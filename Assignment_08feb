Q1. What is Abstraction in OOps? Explain with an example.
ANS- Abstraction is the process of hiding the internal details of an application 
from the outer world. Abstraction is used to describe things in simple terms.
It's used to create a boundary between the application and the client programs.

Q2. Differentiate between Abstraction and Encapsulation. Explain with an example.
ANS- Abstraction is a design level process and it is used to reduce the complexity at 
the designing stage of a project. Encapsulation is an implementation level process, 
and it is used to provide privacy and maintain control over the transparency of data 
at the implementation stage of a project.

Q3. What is abc module in python? Why is it used?
ANS- This module provides the infrastructure for defining abstract base classes (ABCs) in Python,
as outlined in PEP 3119; see the PEP for why this was added to Python.

Q4. How can we achieve data abstraction?
ANS- How can we achieve data abstraction?
Data abstraction is a method where essential elements are displayed to the user and trivial elements
are kept hidden. In Java, abstraction is achieved by using the abstract keyword for classes and interfaces.
In abstract classes, we can have abstract methods as well as concrete methods.

Q5. Can we create an instance of an abstract class? Explain your answer.
ANS- No, we can't create an object of an abstract class. But we can create a reference variable of an abstract class.
The reference variable is used to refer to the objects of derived classes (subclasses of abstract class).
