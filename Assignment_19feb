Q1. What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?

Ans- Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.
Some of the features of Flask are: Lightweight: It is a lightweight framework as it is independent of external libraries. It gives a quick start to the
web development process of complex applications. Independent: Flask gives independent or full control to the developer for creating applications.

Q2. Create a simple Flask application to display ‘Hello World!!’. Attach the screenshot of the output in Jupyter Notebook.

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello_world():
    return "<h1>Hello, World!</h1>"

if __name__=="__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0")
    
    
Q3. What is App routing in Flask? Why do we use app routes?

Ans- App routing is used to map the specific URL with the associated function that is intended to perform some task.

Q4. Create a “/welcome” route to display the welcome message “Welcome to ABC Corporation” and a “/” route to show the following
details: Company Name: ABC Corporation Location: India Contact Detail: 999-999-9999

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def Company_details():
    return "<h1>Company Name: ABC Corporation Location: India Contact Detail: 999-999-9999</h1>"

@app.route("/welcome")
def welcome():
    return "<h1>Welcome to ABC Corporation</h1>"
if __name__=="__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0")
    
    
Q5. What function is used in Flask for URL Building? Write a Python code to demonstrate the working of the url_for() function.

Ans- The url_for() function is very useful for dynamically building a URL for a specific function. The function accepts the name of 
a function as first argument, and one or more keyword arguments, each corresponding to the variable part of URL.

from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)  
  
@app.route('/admin')  
def admin():  
    return 'admin'  
  
@app.route('/librarion')  
def librarion():  
    return 'librarion'  
  
@app.route('/student')  
def student():  
    return 'student'  
  
@app.route('/user/<name>')  
def user(name):  
    if name == 'admin':  
        return redirect(url_for('admin'))  
    if name == 'librarion':  
        return redirect(url_for('librarion'))  
    if name == 'student':  
        return redirect(url_for('student'))  
if __name__ =='__main__':  
    app.run(debug = True)
